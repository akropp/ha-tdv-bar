You learn:

* how to install HACS in the development environment
* how to layout the Github repository for a custom HACS card
* how to use the HACS repository

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to bring your card to HACS by preparing a
repository on Github satisfying the requirements. It will be a custom HACS
repository. We don't register it as a default repository to not pollute it with
myriads of toggle cards.
